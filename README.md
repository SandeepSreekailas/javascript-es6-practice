# Modern JavaScript Practice

This repository contains my practice files for learning modern JavaScript (ES6+) concepts such as destructuring, spread & rest operators, arrow functions, promises, async/await, fetch API, array methods, modules, and the `this` keyword. Each topic is organized into separate folders with simple examples for better understanding.
